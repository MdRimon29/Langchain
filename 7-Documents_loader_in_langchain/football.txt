The ball rolls across the grassy ground,  
A whistle blows, a thundering sound.  
Boots strike leather, hearts beat fast,  
In football’s world, all worries pass.  

The crowd erupts, their voices rise,  
Dreams reflected in eager eyes.  
A striker sprints, defenders chase,  
Victory written in every face.  

The goalkeeper waits, alert and strong,  
Reading the game, where players throng.  
The ball arcs high, a hopeful flight,  
A clash of wills beneath the light.  

Midfield warriors weave and spin,  
Turning chaos to a planned win.  
Pass by pass, they paint the field,  
A moving art no wall can shield.  

Coaches shout from lines so near,  
Their tactics carved for all to hear.  
A single goal, a fleeting chance,  
Can spark the world in joyful dance.  

Flags are waving, drums resound,  
Every kick shakes holy ground.  
Nations pause to watch this play,  
For football lives in hearts each day.  

The net shakes wild, the fans all scream,  
A goal fulfilled a lifelong dream.  
The scorer lifts his arms to skies,  
A hero born in millions’ eyes.  

From dusty streets where children run,  
To stadiums shining in the sun,  
The game unites, the game inspires,  
Igniting hopes, igniting fires.  

Legends rise and legends fade,  
But love for football never decayed.  
Through triumph sweet and bitter pain,  
The beautiful game shall still remain.  

The ball is freedom, joy, and fight,  
It glows beneath the stadium light.  
From kickoff till the final call,  
Football’s the greatest game of all.  

It teaches lessons, deep and true,  
Of teamwork strong and courage too.  
The bond of sweat, of loss, of win,  
The spirit that we hold within.  

Across the world, in every land,  
Children play with dreams so grand.  
With every kick, with every cheer,  
The soul of football lingers here.  

So let the whistle mark the start,  
Of battles fierce, of beating heart.  
A hundred lines, yet still can’t say,  
What football means in every way.  

It’s laughter, tears, it’s song, it’s art,  
It’s stitched inside the human heart.  
From dawn till dusk, from dusk till dawn,  
The love of football lingers on.
